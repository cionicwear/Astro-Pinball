## Instructions

Unlike the original version of the game, this rendition is controlled exclusively through the Gateway. Navigate to a `Game` protocol, calibrate your devices as you'd like, and then on the `Game` screen use either your limbs or the gamepad to control the flippers!

## Local Dev
Run `npm install` to install dependencies. After making any changes to the game, run `npm run-script build` to rebuild the `bundle.js` that the game depends on.
